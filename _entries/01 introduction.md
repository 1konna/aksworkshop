Welcome to the Azure Kubernetes Workshop. In this lab, you'll go through tasks that will help you master the basic and more advanced topics required to deploy an application to Kubernetes on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and setup automated build, security scans, and deployments using Codefresh CI/CD and Aqua Security.

Some of the things youâ€™ll be going through:

- Kubernetes deployments, services and ingress
- Deploying MongoDB using Helm
- Azure Monitor for Containers, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and the Cluster Autoscaler
- Building CI/CD pipelines using Codefresh and Azure Container Registry
- Setting up security scans using Aqua and enforcing policy
