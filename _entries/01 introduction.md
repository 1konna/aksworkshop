Welcome to the Azure Kubernetes Challenge. In this workshop, you'll go through increasingly robust tasks that will help you master the basic and more advanced topics required to deploy your applications to Kubernetes on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

You'll need to find out some of the steps yourself, but rest assured you'll have the hints and links to the relevant documentation in each task.

If you are really stuck, you can ask the proctors for help or peek at the solution.

### Prerequisites

#### Tools

If you're intending to run the tasks on your personal laptop, you'll need to install the tools below:

| Tool | URL     |
|------|---------|
| Azure CLI    | <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest> |
| Docker       | <https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms>        |

You can also opt to use the Azure Cloud Shell accessible at <https://shell.azure.com> once you login with an Azure subscription.
