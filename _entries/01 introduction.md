Welcome to the Azure Kubernetes Challenge. In this workshop, you'll go through increasingly robust challenges that will help you master the basic and more advanced topics required to deploy your applications to Kubernetes on Azure Kubernetes Service.

For most of the challenges, you won't find step-by-step instructions on how to do each task. You'll need to find out some of the steps yourself, but rest assured you'll have the hints and links to the relevant documentation in each task. For the really challenging tasks, you'll find a possible solution that you can peek at.
