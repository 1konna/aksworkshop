title: The Azure Kubernetes Challenge

<p>
Welcome to the Azure Kubernetes Challenge. In this workshop, you'll go through increasingly robust challenges that will help you master the basic and more advanced topics required to deploy your applications to Kubernetes on Azure Kubernetes Service.
</p>
<p>
The format of this workshop is a bit different. You'll notice that you won't find step-by-step instructions on how to do each task. You'll need to find out some of the steps yourself, but rest assured you'll have the hints and links to the relevant documentation in each task.
</p>

We kindly ask you not to share this content outside of the challenge so as not to give it away for future participants :)

Enjoy and have fun!
