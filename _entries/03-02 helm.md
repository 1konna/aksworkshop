title: Package your app with Helm
---

You spent quite a lot of time setting up the application with multiple Kubernetes config files. Wouldn't it be nice to package your entire application and be able to deploy it with Helm, just like you can deploy MongoDB?


### Tasks

#### Install Helm on your cluster

Before you use Helm packages you need to install the server side part of Helm (called Tiller) on your cluster.


Make sure you run `helm init` from Cloud Shell before continuing.

```sh
helm init
```

Once the command finishes with success, you can verify it by visiting the [Codefresh Helm dashboard](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/new-helm/helm-releases-management/).
Expand the Helm section on the left sidebar and choose the *Releases* menu item. You should see an empty cluster like this.

#### Package your app as a Helm chart

Consider using template variables to be able to quickly change environment variables you pass into the chart.



You can create a new chart, and call it `captureorder` through using `helm create captureorder`. You can also download the pre configured Helm chart code from [captureorder-chart.zip](yaml-solutions/devops/helm/captureorder-chart.zip), unzip it and save it in the same repository that holds your source code.

Let's look at the folder structure.

![Helm example](media/cicd/5-helm-tree.png)

So in the `templates` folder, you'll find 3 files, corresponding to the 3 YAML files that you've used to deploy the application to Kubernetes before. The main difference is that many of the constants, like the image name, number of replicas and environment variables have been parametrized so that the actual values can be passed at deploy time through the `values.yaml` file or through the command line.

You'll also find a `values.yaml` file with some default values.

> **Hint**
> - You'll need  to change `<unique-acr-name>` to your Azure Container Registry endpoint.
> - It isn't a secure practice to store sensitive data like passwords in the config file. The better approach in production would be to use Kubernetes Secrets.

```yaml
minReplicaCount: 1
maxReplicaCount: 2
targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
teamName: azch-team
appInsightKey: ""
mongoHost: "orders-mongo-mongodb.default.svc.cluster.local"
mongoUser: "orders-user"
mongoPassword: "orders-password"

image:
  repository: <unique-acr-name>.azurecr.io/captureorder
  tag: # Will be set at command runtime
  pullPolicy: Always
  
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
  port: 80

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
```


#### Reconfigure the build pipeline to use Helm

Since you will use Helm for this deployment, you need to change the deployment pipeline to use the [native Helm deployment step](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/new-helm/using-helm-in-codefresh-pipeline/)
instead of [custom Kubectl commands](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/deploy-to-kubernetes/custom-kubectl-commands/).


Change your Codefresh pipeline (or create a new one) to the following [codefresh.yml](yaml-solutions/devops/codefresh/build-push-helm.yml)


```yaml
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
- build
- deploy
steps:
  BuildingDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    stage: build
    type: build
    image_name: captureorder
    working_directory: ./
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  PushingDockerImage:
    title: Pushing Docker Image to Azure
    stage: build
    type: push
    candidate: '${{BuildingDockerImage}}'
    tag: ${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}
    registry: myazureregistry
  DeployMyChart:
    image: 'codefresh/cfstep-helm:2.13.0'
    title: Deploying Helm chart
    stage: deploy
    environment:
      - CHART_REF=captureorder
      - RELEASE_NAME=captureorder-api
      - KUBE_CONTEXT=<my-cluster-name>
      - VALUE_image_pullPolicy=Always
      - VALUE_image_tag='${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}'
{% endraw %} 
```

Remember to change the name your cluster in the Helm deployment step (no quotes are needed).

Then run the pipeline

![Helm deployment pipeline](media/codefresh/helm-deploy.png)



Validate that the release was deployed and that you can access the Orders API. You can view the release logs to get the IP or
visit the Codefresh Helm Dashboard. You will see an updated Helm deployment.

![Helm Release](media/codefresh/helm-release.png)

You can click on the release and see extra information on it such as the template and its values.


This concludes the Helm pipeline.
