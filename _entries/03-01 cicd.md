Your development team are making an increasing number of modifications to your
application code. It is no longer feasible to manually deploy updates. You are
required to create a robust DevOps pipeline supporting CI/CD. Modifications must
first be deployed into a test environment before manual approval enables
deployment to production.

1.  Create a second Kubernetes namespace for test workloads

2.  Either fork or copy the source repositories on GitHub. 

* Order Capture API
Git hub repo - https://github.com/shanepeckham/captureorderack/ **Note we are using branch v3**

* Event Listener 
Git hub repo - https://github.com/shanepeckham/rabbitmqlistenerack/ **Note we are using branch v3**

* Order Fulfill API
Git hub repo - https://github.com/shanepeckham/fulfillorderack/ **Note we are using branch v3**

3. You will need to provision an Azure Container Registry

4. Create a CI/CD pipeline using VSTS, Jenkins or tooling of your choice
