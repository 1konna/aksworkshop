title: DevOps - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
---

Your development team are making an increasing number of modifications to your application code. It is no longer feasible to manually deploy updates.

You are required to create a robust DevOps pipeline supporting CI/CD to deploy code changes.

> **Hint** The source code registries on GitHub contain an `azure-pipelines.yml` definition that you can use with Azure Pipelines to build the containers. You may also roughly follow the steps inside on your own CI/CD tool such as Jenkins.

### Tasks

1. Either fork or copy the source repositories on GitHub.
1. Add the YAML configuration to your repositories. Start using explicit image tags, instead of `latest`.
1. Build the images and push them to your own registry on Docker Hub or the Azure Container Registry you provisioned before.
1. Create one or more CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, Jenkins or tooling of your choice to build and release.
