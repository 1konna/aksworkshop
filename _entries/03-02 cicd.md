title: DevOps - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

Your development team are making an increasing number of modifications to your application code. It is no longer feasible to manually deploy updates.

You are required to create a robust DevOps pipeline supporting CI/CD to deploy code changes.

> **Hint**
> - The source code registries on GitHub contain an `azure-pipelines.yml` definition that you can use with Azure Pipelines to build the containers. This pipeline pushes the images to Docker Hub. **You may need to edit it a bit if you want to do something different, like pushing to Azure Container Registry**. You may also roughly follow the steps inside on your own CI/CD tool such as Jenkins.
> - Make sure you tokenize the Docker image tags in your Kubernetes YAML configuration files instead of using `latest`. You'll need to set those in the build pipeline to the Build ID.
> - You may use the diagram below as guidance.

### Tasks

If you peek into the solutions, they're using Azure DevOps. You may choose doing the same process on Jenkins or another CI/CD tool of your choice.

#### Fork the source repositories on GitHub or import them to Azure Repos

{% collapsible %}

Create a new project on Azure DevOps then import the code of `captureorder` service located at <http://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder.git>

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create build pipeline for the application Docker container

{% collapsible %}

Save the YAML below as `azure-pipelines.yml` or download it from [azure-pipelines.captureorder.yml](yaml-solutions/devops/azure-pipelines.captureorder.yml) and store it in your code repository (`azch-captureorder`)as `azure-pipelines.yml`

This simply runs `docker build`, `docker login` and `docker push`, tagging the image with the current `BuildId`.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu 16.04'

variables:
  imageName: 'captureorder:$(Build.BuildId)'
  # define three more variables acrName, dockerId and dockerPassword in the build pipeline in UI

steps:
- script: docker build -f Dockerfile -t $(acrName).azurecr.io/$(imageName) .
  displayName: 'docker build'

- script: docker login -u $(dockerId) -p $(dockerPassword) $(acrName).azurecr.io
  displayName: 'docker login'

- script: docker push $(acrName).azurecr.io/$(imageName)
  displayName: 'docker push'
```

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Build the code in `azch-captureorder` as a Docker image and push it to the Azure Container Registry you provisioned before

{% collapsible %}

Setup a build using YAML pipelines

![Setup build](media/cicd/2-setup-build.png)

Choose YAML as the pipeline template

![Pipeline Config-As-Code](media/cicd/2-config-as-code.png)

Browse to and select the `azure-pipelines.yml` file you created above. You may also change the agent to be `Hosted Ubuntu`

![Select pipeline config file](media/cicd/2-agent-yaml.png)

Define variables in your build pipeline in the web UI:

- `dockerId`: The admin user name/Service Principal ID for the Azure Container Registry.
- `acrName`: The Azure Container Registry name.
- `dockerPassword`: The admin password/Service Principal password for Azure Container Registry.

![Create variable group](media/cicd/2-variable-group.png)

> **Hint:**
> - Refer to <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-aks#access-with-kubernetes-secret> to obtain the Service Principal ID/Service Principal Password or enable the Azure Container Registry admin user.
> - It would be better if you store those variables as a `Variable Group` instead of a `Pipeline Variable`. This will allow you to reuse them across pipelines.

Run the build pipeline and verify that it works

![Build pipeline log](media/cicd/2-build-pipeline-log.png)

Verify that the image ends up in your Azure Container Registry

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create a new Azure DevOps Repo, for example `azch-captureorder-kubernetes` to hold the the YAML configuration for Kubernetes

The reason you're creating a separate repository, is that the Kubernetes deployment configuration is a deployment artifact, which is indepenedent from your code. You may want to change how the container is deployed, which Kubernetes services are created, etc. without triggering a new container build. For this reason, having a seperate repository is the recommended way to go about this, to encourage seperation of concerns. This decouples the application code from where it runs. You build containers in one pipeline but you're not concerned where they would be deployed. You may have multiple other repos and pipelines controlling how you deploy.

{% collapsible %}

Go ahead and create a new repo and call it `azch-captureorder-kubernetes`. Hit the **Initialize** button to create a `README.md` file and add the `.gitignore` file.

![Create a new repo and initialize it](media/cicd/1-create-and-initialize.png)

In the new repository, create a folder `yaml` and add the required YAML files you created before for the service you're building.

![Create YAML folder](media/cicd/1-create-yaml-folder.png)

You may download the YAML files again from the links below. Make sure you store them in the `yaml` folder on the `azch-captureorder-kubernetes` repository.

- [captureorder-deployment.yaml](yaml-solutions/devops/captureorder-deployment.yaml)
- [captureorder-service.yaml](yaml-solutions/devops/captureorder-service.yaml)
- [captureorder-hpa.yaml](yaml-solutions/devops/captureorder-hpa.yaml)

> **Hint** - One thing you'll notice is that, in `captureorder-deployment.yaml`, you'll need to change the image name `<unique-acr-name>.azurecr.io/captureorder:##BUILD_ID##`. Put in your Azure Container Registry name.
> - Also notice the `##BUILD_ID##`. This is a placeholder that will get replaced further down the line by the release pipeline by the actual version being deployed.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create build pipeline for the Kubernetes config files

{% collapsible %}

Save the YAML below as `azure-pipelines.yml` or download it from [azure-pipelines.captureorder-k8s.yml](yaml-solutions/devops/azure-pipelines.captureorder-k8s.yml) and store it in your Kubernetes config repository (`azch-captureorder-kubernetes`) as `azure-pipelines.yml`

This essentially copies the `yaml` folder as a build artifact. The artifact will be picked up by the Release pipeline later on for deployment to the cluster.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu 16.04'

steps:
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  displayName: 'publish yaml folder as an artifact'
  inputs:
    artifactName: 'yaml'
    pathToPublish: 'yaml'
```

Similarly to how you setup the Docker images build pipeline, setup a build pipeline using YAML pipelines for `azch-captureorder-kubernetes` repo. Run it once you save and verify you get the `yaml` folder copied as a build artifact.
