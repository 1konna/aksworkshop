title: DevOps - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
---

Your development team are making an increasing number of modifications to your application code. It is no longer feasible to manually deploy updates.

You are required to create a robust DevOps pipeline supporting CI/CD to deploy code changes.

> **Hint**
> - The source code registries on GitHub contain an `azure-pipelines.yml` definition that you can use with Azure Pipelines to build the containers. This pipeline pushes the images to Docker Hub. **You may need to edit it a bit if you want to do something different, like pushing to Azure Container Registry**. You may also roughly follow the steps inside on your own CI/CD tool such as Jenkins.
> - Make sure you tokenize the Docker image tags in your Kubernetes YAML configuration files instead of using `latest`. You'll need to set those in the build pipeline to the Build ID.

### Tasks

1. Fork the source repositories on GitHub or import them to Azure Repos.
1. For each app, add the YAML configuration to the repository.
1. Create one or more CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, Jenkins or tooling of your choice to build and release to your cluster.
