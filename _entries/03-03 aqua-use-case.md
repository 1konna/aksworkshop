title: Using Aqua Security Platform
---

We are now run through the following use cases with Aqua.

    Image Assurance
        - Manually add image
        - Connect to your ACR
        - Scan an Image from your ACR
        - Create and edit Image Assurance Policy
    Runtime Protection
        - Block Unregistered Images
        - Block certain executable from running
        - Prevent Drift from happening



### Image Assurance

Image Assurance is a subsystem of Aqua CSP. It is responsible for the following:

> * Scanning your images for known security issues (vulnerabilities, sensitive data, and malware).
> * Evaluating the scanning findings, according to Image Assurance Policies that you define and configure
> * Determining whether images are compliant, based on these policies and other system settings
> * Taking security-related actions that you define, such as preventing risky images from being deployed in a container, or reporting the image as "failed" to your CI/CD development system.
> * Providing complete reporting on all security risks found. You can review the results of the security evaluation either in the Aqua Server or in a SIEM or other system.


#### What is scanned?

Aqua scans images for CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) listed on the NVD web site, a U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data.

These image components are scanned:

> * OS Packages: Aqua checks the published security advisories issued by Operating System vendors for the various packages and versions related to their operating systems that are included in the image. These advisories list known vulnerabilities.
> * Programming Packages: Aqua checks the lists of known vulnerabilities for packages for several programming languages, according to version. It also checks whether there are replacement versions for packages with issues that fail Image Assurance Policies.
> * Configuration files: Aqua checks the image for sensitive data files such as keys or passwords, based on the patterns. 


#### Manually add an image to scan

We will now add an image from the public docker hub registry. 
    Step 1) Click on "Images" on the left navigation section
    Step 2) Click on the + ADD IMAGES icon on the upper right side of the screen
    Step 3) Make sure the registry is set to Docker Hub, and then type in centos and click Search
    Step 4) Select the first repository line item, centos
    Step 5) Then select the latest tag and click on add

This is what it should look like: 
![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-add-centos.png)

This will start the scan of the latest centos image from Docker Hub.   It will not take long to scan the image.  Once finished scanning, feel free to view the results, and see how many vulnerabilities were detected by Aqua.

#### Connect to your ACR

Now we will integrate with your ACR so you can pull in other images that might be on there.
    Step 1) Click on System on the left Navigation
    Step 2) Select "Integrations"
    Step 3) Click on the "Add Registry" button
    Step 4) Give the Registry a name:  ACR for example.
    Step 5) Under "Registry Type" select "Azure Container Registry"
    Step 6) Fill in the URL , Username, and Password for your ACR
    Step 7) Click on Test connection, and if successful , then click on Save Changes.

We now have integrated with your ACR , and you will have another option to pull your images from.
Like we did for manually adding images from Docker Hub, we can add an image from your ACR.
    Step 1) Click on "Images" on the left navigation section
    Step 2) Click on the "+ ADD IMAGES" button on the upper right side of the screen
    Step 3) Make sure the registry is set to ACR, and then type in a name of an image and click Search
    Step 4) Select the repository.
    Step 5) Then select the a tag and click on "Add"

This will start a scan of that image from your ACR.  Once finished scanning, you can view the results and see what the security posture of that image is. 


#### Create a Image Assurance Policy
Whenever Aqua scans an image, it checks the image against the Image Assurance policy.  Currently we don't have a Policy so everything scanned will be in the approved state, even if it contains a vulnerability.

Let's create a Policy now. 

    Step 1) Click on Policies
    Step 2) Select Assurance Policy
    Step 3) Select the Default Image Policy (the first one)
    
We can add any Available Image Assurance Control from the right side, by clicking on the "+" icon next to the control we want.

For this session, we will just add the "Vulnerability Severity" control .
Once added, select the severity level "High" , and then click "Save Changes"

This policy will mark any image as "Non-compliant" if it contains at least one high severity vulnerability.

Click on the Images section now, and you open up the centos image we scanned.  Notice how it's marked as Non-compliant. Before it was marked as Approved.

#### Create a Runtime Policy

You can configure one or more Runtime Policies to restrict the runtime activities of containers, according to the security requirements of your organization. Restriction can mean either or both of the following:
> * Preventing the running of the container. For example, you can configure a Runtime Policy to block the running of a container based on an image that has been found to be non-compliant during Image Assurance.
> * Preventing the execution by the container of certain runtime activities. For example, a Runtime Policy could block running a blacklisted executable in a container, or prevent particular volumes from being mounted by a container.


Let's create the Runtime Policy now.

    Step 1) Click on "Policies" on the left navigation
    Step 2) Select "Runtime Policies"
    Step 3) Select the "Default" Policy

The Default Policy might contain a bunch of controls already.  Make sure that this Policy is "Enable" and enforcement mode is set to "Enforce". 

If not already added, we should add the following controls:
    > * Executable Blacklist - add /bin/date
    > * Drift Prevention
    > * Block Unregistered Images
    > * Block Non-compliant Images

Save changes.



#### Block Unregistered Images

Now this policy will Block any unregistered images, any non-compliant images, and block black listed executable and prevent drift.   To demo this, we will need to return to the Azure cloud shell. 

From your Azure cloud shell, we are going to deploy a few applications

Type the following command to run an nginx container

```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

This will try to deploy the nginx application, but Aqua will block it.

Type in:
```sh
kubectl get pods
```

This will list all the pods running, but you will see an Error on the nginx pod.

To view the detail, we will need to describe the pod.   Run the following command to view the details:

```sh
kubectl describe pod NAMEOFPOD
```
The last line would show why Aqua is blocking it. 

> **Note** To delete the nginx pod name, you can run ```sh kubectl delete deployment nginx. ```


Let's register this nginx container with Aqua, so Aqua doesn't block it again. 

    Step 1) Click on Images
    Step 2) Click on "+ Add IMAGES" 
    Step 3) Registry should be Docker Hub, search for and take the latest tag of nginx
    Step 4) Click on "Add", and let Aqua scan and register the image.

Now that the nginx:latest image is register with Aqua, we can deploy it without having to worry that Aqua will be blocking it. 

```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

#### Block certain executable from running

In our Default Runtime policy we had blocked date from running.  If we exec into the pod, we should not be able to execute the date command. 

Run the following command, but replace <PODNAME> with the name of the nginx pod.
```sh
kubectl exec -it <PODNAME> bash
```

This will put us in the nginx pod.   Try to run the date command.  You will get permission denied.  This is because aqua is blocking that executable from running.

#### Drift Protection

Aquaâ€™s image drift prevention ensures that containers remain immutable and do not deviate from their originating image, further limiting the potential of abuse. 

To simulate a drift, we will copy an allowed executable, like `ls`, to another name `sl`.

```sh 
    cp /bin/ls /bin/sl
```

When we try to run the sl command, Aqua will be blocking it, as sl was not in the original image, so you will get a "Permission Denied" error.


There is a lot more that can be done with Aqua which we haven't touch upon due to the limited time.   Other controls are: Network Nano Segmentation, Secrets Management, and Compliance report.
