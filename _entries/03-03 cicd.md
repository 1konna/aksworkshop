Your development team are making an increasing number of modifications to your application code. It is no longer feasible to manually deploy updates.

You are required to create a robust DevOps pipeline supporting CI/CD. Modifications must first be deployed into a test environment before manual approval enables deployment to production.

### Tasks

1. Create a second Kubernetes namespace for test workloads
1. Either fork or copy the source repositories on GitHub.
1. Provision an Azure Container Registry
1. Create a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps, Jenkins or tooling of your choice
