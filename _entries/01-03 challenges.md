The challenges are intended to be a challenge! Useful resources are provided to help you work through each challenge but step by step instructions are not provided. To ensure you progress at a good pace ensure workload is divided between team members where possible. This may mean anticipating work that might be required in a later challenge.

The first 2 challenges, under section 2, involve getting the sample application provisioned and **must be carried out sequentially**. After this there is flexibility as to how you proceed.

A proctor will have arranged for you to be added to theazurechallenge Azure Active Directory. When logging into Azure from the Azure CLI we recommend using ```az login --tenant theazurechallenge.onmicrosoft.com``` to ensure you are connected to the appropriate subscription.

If you feel you need assistance at any time, please ask a proctor.
