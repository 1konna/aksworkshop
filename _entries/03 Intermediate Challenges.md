Now the application is running you need to work to make it a robust production ready service. 
Despite the easiness and convenience of AKS, the service is still in preview and lacks some key functionalities, which should be available at GA. Luckily, we can leverage another Azure container service (ACS engine). An open source tool, that allows the deployment of a custom Kubernetes cluster on Azure infrastructure. 
ACS is a test bed incubator for AKS, and its capabilities should be integrated to AKS over time.    
During this phase, we will focus on:
- Security at the different layers (Infrstructure, Application)
- Advanced monitoring and alerting     
- Business continuity...

You have been given a number of potential areas to work on to improve the application.

 **Discuss within your team which challenges you will attempt and consider splitting tasks. It is not anticipated that you will complete all the challenges so focus on those you feel are most relevant to your team.**
