Now the application is running you need to work to make it a robust production ready service.

You have been given a number of potential areas to work on to improve the application.

> **Note** Some of those challenges would require you to re-provision the AKS cluster. We hope that you have already documented and saved the Kubernetes YAML files to enable you to quickly get back on track. Otherwise, have a look at using something like `kubectl get all --export=true --all-namespaces -o yaml > export.yaml`. If you try to `kubectl apply -f export.yaml`, your mileage may vary, use this as a last resort.

***Each challenge, successfully implemented counts for 5 points.***

 **Discuss within your team which challenges you will attempt and consider splitting tasks. It is not anticipated that you will complete all the challenges so focus on those you feel are most relevant to your team.**
