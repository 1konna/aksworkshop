Your organisation requires that the application is deployed to Kubernetes running on Azure. You will need to use features available in Kubernetes 1.8.

You have found out that Azure has a managed Kubernetes service, AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). This is currently in preview, and at the time of writing the default version of Kubernetes deployed is 1.7.7, but AKS does support version 1.8.
You need to:

1. Deploy Kubernetes to Azure, using CLI or Azure portal
2. Ensure you and your colleagues can connect to the cluster using kubectl
