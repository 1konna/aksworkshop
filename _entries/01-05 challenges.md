The challenges are intended to be a challenge! Useful resources are provided to help you work through each challenge. To ensure you progress at a good pace ensure workload is divided between team members where possible. This may mean anticipating work that might be required in a later challenge.

> **Hint**: If you get stuck, you can ask for help from the proctors. You may also choose to peek at the solutions.

### Core tasks

You are expected to at least complete the **Getting up and running** section. This involves setting up a Kubernetes cluster, deploying the application containers from Docker Hub, setting up monitoring and scaling your application.

### DevOps tasks

Once you're done with the above, next would be to include some DevOps flair. **Complete as many tasks as you can**. You'll be moving to a private container repository on Azure Container Registry, setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline for your application and then using Helm to deploy and optionally, using HashiCorp's Terraform to deploy AKS and your application.
