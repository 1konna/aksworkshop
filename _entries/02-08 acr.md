title: Create private highly available container registry 
---

Instead of using the public Docker Hub registry, create your own private container registry using Azure Container Registry (ACR).

### Tasks


#### Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)

**Task Hints**
* Use the Azure CLI to create the ACR instance. There is [a guide in the Azure documentation on creating a new ACR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-azure-cli)
* You will have to pick a globally unique name for your new registry

{% collapsible %}

```sh
az acr create --resource-group <resource-group> --name <unique-acr-name> --sku Standard --location eastus
```

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Use Azure Container Registry Build to push the container images to your new registry

**Task Hints**
* ACR includes a feature called 'ACR Tasks' which can build container images remotely in Azure, and store the resulting image in the registry. [This guide in the ACR documentation covers how to run a quick build task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tutorial-quick-task#build-in-azure-with-acr-tasks)
* The source code of the captureorder project is on GitHub here, `https://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder.git` and can be checked out to your cloud shell session with `git`. It includes the `Dockerfile` to build the image.
* There is no need to run `az acr login` when working the the Cloud Shell.
* When running `az acr build` be careful with the last parameter which is the Docker build context directory, it's usual to `cd` into the directory where the `Dockerfile` is situated, and pass `.` (a single dot) as the build context
* You can tag and name the image however you wish, e.g. `captureorder:v1` or you might want to [use a variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml#run-variables) to dynamically tag the image

> **Note** The Azure Cloud Shell is already authenticated against Azure Container Registry. You don't need to do `az acr login` which also won't work on the Cloud Shell because this requires the Docker daemon to be running.

Clone the application code on Azure Cloud Shell

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder.git
cd azch-captureorder
```

Use Azure Container Registry Build to build and push the container images

```sh
az acr build -t "captureorder:{% raw %}{{.Run.ID}}{% endraw %}" -r <unique-acr-name> .
```

> **Note** You'll get a build ID in a message similar to ``Run ID: ca3 was successful after 3m14s``. Use `ca3` in this example as the image tag in the next step.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Configure your application to pull from your private registry

Before you can use an image stored in a private registry you need to ensure your Kubernetes cluster has access to that registry. 

##### Grant AKS generated Service Principal to ACR

Authorize the AKS cluster to connect to the Azure Container Registry using the AKS generated Service Principal.

Follow the Azure docs to learn how to [grant access using the Azure CLI and attach-acr](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-container-registry-integration#create-a-new-aks-cluster-with-acr-integration). The command can take several minutes.

{% collapsible %}

```sh
az aks update -n <aks-cluster-name>  -g <resource-group> --attach-acr <unique-acr-name>
```

{% endcollapsible %}

After you grant your Kubernetes cluster access to your private registry, you can update your deployment with the image you built in the previous step.

Kubernetes is declarative and keeps a manifest of all object resources. Edit your deployment object with the updated image.

**Task Hints**
* You can edit a live deployment object in Kubernetes with `kubectl edit deployment`. It is suggested to run `export KUBE_EDITOR="nano"` to stop `kubectl` from using the vi editor.
* The image name will need to be fully qualify and include your registry name which will be of the form `<name>.azurecr.io/<image>:<tag>`

{% collapsible %}

From your Azure Cloud Shell run:

`kubectl edit deployment captureorder`

Replace the image tag with the location of the new image on Azure Container Registry. Replace `<build id>` with the ID you got from the message similar to ``Run ID: ca3 was successful after 3m14s`` after the build was completed.

> **Hint** `kubectl edit` launches `vim`. To search in `vim` you can type `/image: azch/captureorder`. Go into **insert** mode by typing `i`, and replace the image with `<unique-acr-name>.azurecr.io/captureorder:<build id>`

Quit the editor by hitting `Esc` then typing `:wq` and run `kubectl get pods -l app=captureorder -w`.

If you successfully granted Kubernetes authorization to your private registry you will see one pod terminating and a new one creating. If the access to your private registry was properly granted to your cluster, your new pod should be up and running within 10 seconds.
