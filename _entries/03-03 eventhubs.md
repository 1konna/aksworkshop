title: Swap out Rabbit MQ for Event Hubs

---
Your organisation has decided it wants to reduce the management overhead and
improve the availability of the Order Capture process by utilising a native Azure
event hub. Replace the Eventlistener RabbitMQ container with a prebuilt Azure
Event Hub listener container with zero downtime.

Azure Event Hubs enables you to use an event driven approach to incorporate first
party Azure services.
