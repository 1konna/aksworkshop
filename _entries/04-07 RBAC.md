title: Advanced - Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

---

Your organization would like to secure access to the Kubernetes dashboard and API access via ``kubectl`` using Azure Active Directory.

> **Hint** Your AKS cluster needs to be already enabled for RBAC. You can't enable RBAC post cluster creation.

### Tasks

* Integrate Azure Active Directory with Azure Kubernetes Service
* Access cluster with Azure AD
* Lock down who can download your `cluster-admin` credentials using `az aks get-credentials --admin`
* Make sure you can still release using Helm and CI/CD processes
