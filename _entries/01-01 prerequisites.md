### Access the Azure Portal

Using the credentials provided by the lab environment screen, navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and authenticate with the provided username and password.

>  **Hint**
>  If you already have an Azure account, you can use that, or to use the lab environment you'll need to use a unique email address.

### Launch Cloud Shell

[Azure Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/cloud-shell/) is a browser-based CLI tool integrated directly into the Azure portal. Cloud shell provides all of the tools you need to manage your Azure resources in a pre-configured, on-demand virtual machine.

You may launch Cloud Shell from the Azure Portal or open a new browser window and navigate to [Azure Cloud Shell https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com).

The first time you launch Cloud Shell you will be prompted to create a resource group, storage account, and Azure Files share. This is a one-time step and will be automatically attached for all sessions. A single file share can be used by both Bash and PowerShell in Cloud Shell.
