title: Advanced - Package your app with Helm

---

You spent quite a lot of time setting up the application with multiple Kubernetes config files. Wouldn't it be nice to package your enitre application and be able to deploy it with Helm, just like you can deploy MongoDB?

### Tasks

* Package your app as a Helm chart and try deploying it again in a new namespace. Consider using template variables to be able to quickly change environment variables you pass into the chart.
* Push the Helm chart to Azure Container Registry.
